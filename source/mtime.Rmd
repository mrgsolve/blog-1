# Introduction
This is just a short post on a simplified implementation of modeled events
in mrgsolve.  

I previously posted [here](2018-modeled-interventions.html) about
modeling interventions in mrgsolve.  All that still works fine.  But I found
myself wanting a more straightforward implementation of the mtime
functionality you get in NONMEM.  

# Example with single mtime
For example, we might wish a rate constant to change at some time 
that is not found in a record in the input data set.  We can make this happen
from the model code itself.  In addition to using `mevent` you can now use
`mtime` to make this happen.  `mtime` is just a simpler subset of the `mevent`
functionality.

Let's make KA change at 2.1 hours (`change_t` parameter in the example below).
```{r, comment = '.', eval=FALSE, code = readLines("mtime_model.txt")}

```

Again, the main motivation for this is just convenience and economy of code:
we register the event time and get that time returned into a variable that 
we can reference later on, checking if we are past that time or not.


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(mrgsolve)

options(mrgsolve.soloc = "build")

mod <- mread_cache("mtime_model.txt")

mod %>% ev(amt=100) %>% mrgsim(delta = 0.222) %>% plot(CENT+KA~time)
```

You won't see the message that we actually stumbled on `2.1` hours in the 
simulation even though it was not in the lineup when the simulation started. 

# Example with several mtimes

We could keep track of several mtimes like this

```{r,eval=FALSE,code = readLines("mtime_model_2.txt")}

```

```{r, message = FALSE}
mod <- mread_cache("mtime_model_2.txt")

mod %>% ev(amt=100) %>% mrgsim() %>% plot(CENT + KA ~ time)
```
