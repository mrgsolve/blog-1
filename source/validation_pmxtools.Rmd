```


I just discovered this nifty tool published by the folks over at Occams (with 
other contributors as well) called [pmxTools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pmxTools).  There 
are a lot of really useful R functions for your pharmacometrics workflow in this 
package and worth checking it out in depth! 

What I want to focus on for this post is how we can use this package to 
cross validate mrgsolve output: we'll simulate with pmxTools and mrgsolve
just to see the different workflows and check the output values.  If
users are interested in other validation tests for mrgsolve, please see the 
document [here](https://github.com/mrgsolve/nmtests).  _This is not a 
"lets-go-head-to-head with another project" type post_.  I just found this 
tool very useful as a complement to my workflow.  I hope you find it useful too.


# Setup

```{r setup2}
library(mrgsolve)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
options(mrgsolve.soloc="build")
```

```{r}
library(pmxTools)
```

# Two-compartment infusion

## Simulate with `pmxTools::pk_curve`

You can use this function to generate a PK profile based on super-positioning.


To simulate a 2-compartment model after IV infusion of 100 mg over 10 hours, 
first define a list of pk parameters, including `tinf`, the infusion duration

```{r}
pars <- list(CL = 1, V1 = 4, V2 = 50, Q = 5, tinf=10)
```


Call `pk_curve` and provide simulation times, dose regimen (including 
`dose`, `ii`, `addl`), the model parameters, and select the model, 
in this case it is `2cmt_infusion`


```{r}
calc <- pk_curve(
  t = seq(0,400,0.1), 
  dose = 100, 
  ii = 24, 
  addl = 9, 
  params = pars, 
  model="2cmt_infusion"
)
```

```{r}
head(calc)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = calc, aes(t,cp)) + geom_line() + theme_bw()
```

__Pretty easy!__

## Simulate with mrgsolve

We can load the 2-compartment model from our model libary, and 
update the parameter set.  We make an event object with the dosing 
information and simulate:


```{r}
mod <- 
  modlib("pk2", delta = 0.1, end = 400) %>% 
  param(CL = 1, V2 = 4, V3 = 50, Q = 5)

e <- ev(amt = 100, rate = 10, ii = 24, addl = 9, cmt = 2)

out <- mrgsim_e(mod,e, obsonly=TRUE, recsort=3)
```

```{r}
plot(out, CP~time)

head(out)
```




## Are they the same?

We can check the difference between the values:

```{r}
summary(out$CP-calc[["cp"]])
```


# Oral dosing example

To do a model for first-order absorption

```{r}
pars <- list(CL = 1, V = 20, ka = 1.2)

calc <- pk_curve(
  t = seq(0,400,0.1), 
  dose = 100, 
  ii = 24, 
  addl = 9, 
  params = pars, 
  model = "1cmt_oral"
)

ggplot(calc, aes(t,cp)) + geom_line() + theme_bw()
```

```{r}
mod <- modlib("pk1", param = list(CL=1, V=20, KA=1.2), end=400, delta=0.1)

out <- mrgsim_e(
  mod, 
  mutate(e, rate = 0, cmt = 1),
  recsort=3, 
  obsonly=TRUE
)

plot(out, EV+CP~time)

summary(out$CP-calc[["cp"]])
```

# Caution
Please note that we used some specific options to get the results exactly 
comparable.  It really does take a lot of care to ensure that the setup
is exactly the same for both tools when doing comparisons like this.  If you 
start benchmarking and the results don't come out the same, please
go back and double check your setup to make sure you haven't made any 
assumptions about how each tool works. 

# Building our community

As I noted earlier, the goal of this post wasn't to go head-to-head with
pmxTools.  Rather, I wanted to show how the mrgsolve project can take advantage
of this great tool to help our development and validate what we're doing.  I can
only hope that others also find mrgsolve as useful for their project, validation
or other type of simulation work that needs to get done.  This sort of synergy
between development projects is only possible with an open-source community 
dedicated to open and public development projects and sharing of knowledge and 
tools.  The more we do this in our pharmacometrics community, the more progress 
we'll all make and our science will advance.  And we will have done it together.
