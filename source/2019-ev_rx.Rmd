I got into pharmacometrics after studying and working as a pharmacist, both 
in a community pharmacy (interning while I was a pharmacy student) and in an 
inpatient (hospital) pharmacy (practicing as a pharmacist while studying 
pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology).  So I always thought it would be 
cool to have mrgsolve take in dosing informationlike you would see on a Rx or
written in a chart

```{yamle}
sig: 100 mg po daily x 7
```

This post introduces something new in mrgsolve 0.9.0 that works along 
those lines.  

# Review

First, a review: we have these things called <red>event objects</red> in mrgsolve:
they are simple ways to specify a part of a dosing regimen.  They are meant 
to be quick and easy to create and you are able to combine different 
"elementary" objects together according to certain rules to make more 
complex dosing regimens. 

For example, say we want a dose every day for one week.  Assuming that our model
is in hours, we could write

```{r}
e1 <- ev(amt = 100, ii = 24, until = 24*7)

e1
```

```{r}
mod <- modlib("pk1", delta=0.1) %>% Req(CP)

mrgsim_e(mod, e1, end = 24*9) %>% plot
```

And if I wanted to follow that by a week at every 48 hours, first create
the q48h event object
```{r}
e2 <- ev(amt = 100, ii = 48, until = 24*7)
e2
```

and then combine them together in a sequence
```{r}
e <- seq(e1,e2)

e
```

```{r}
mrgsim_e(mod, e, end = 168*3) %>% plot
```

And then if we wanted to repeat 3 cycles of that

```{r}
e4 <- ev_repeat(e, n=3, as.ev = TRUE)

mrgsim_e(mod, e4, end = 168*8) %>% plot
```

# New in 0.9.0

New in 0.9.0 is a grammar of specifying some of this dose event information. I've
been wanting to do something like this for a while, but never quite had the 
right implementation.  The current try isn't perfect, but I thought it was
worth it to give a try and see if we can improve.  

## Bolus doses
```{r}
e5 <- ev_rx("100 q 24 x7 then 100 q48 x 4")

e5
```

```{r}
mrgsim_e(mod, e5, end = 168*3) %>% plot()
```

The syntax is: 

- Start with `amt`
- Dosing interval follows `q`
- Total number of doses follows `x`
- A second part of the sequence follows `then`


## Infusion

To do an infusion, the duration of the infusion comes after `over`

```{r}
e6 <- ev_rx("100 over 10 q 48 x 3")

e6

mrgsim_e(mod, e6, end = 168) %>% plot()
```


Hrm ... but we wanted the infusion to be IV, not in the depot compartment.  To 
do that, put the compartment number after `in`

```{r}
e7 <- ev_rx("100 over 10 in 2 q 48 x 3")

e7

mrgsim_e(mod,e7, end = 168) %>% plot()
```

## Another sequence

Rather than `then` you can separate by `comma`.  Also, see if you can tell
what `after` does here:

```{r}
e <- ev_rx("100 q 24 x 7, 50 q 12 x 14, 200 q48 x 3 after 72")

e
```

It still takes a fair amount of text to get all of this out, but hopefully 
the notation is relatively compact and expressive. 

```{r}
mrgsim_e(mod, e, end = 600) %>% plot()
```

# Important note
I don't see this ever replacing the regular event object construction.  Maybe 
it is force of habit for me, but I still regularly just use the constructor.  That
might be easier in the end.  For now, this alternate syntax is sort of proof of
concept to see how it might work.  Definitely you can't do everything you might 
want to do with this syntax.  In that case, just revert to the usual constructors.
