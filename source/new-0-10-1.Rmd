# Introduction

This blog post shows some of the new features that came into mrgsolve starting
with version `10.0.0` (October 2019) and `0.10.1` (February 2020).  The purpose 
is to illustrate what is possible rather than detailed documentation.  

# Steady-state

This is a big topic, so I put together a [separate blog entry](steady-state.html) 
to look at new features around steady state. 

# house is now exported

Since the beginning, we have maintained a model **inside mrgsolve itself** that
we call `house`.  It's a basic PKPD model that we use to test and demo. The 
interesting thing about this model is that it is compiled when mrgsolve is
installed.  So the model is always ready to go. 

It use to be unexported so you would have to access the model like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mod <- mrgsolve:::house()
```

The `:::` means that we go into the mrgsolve namespace to call the function 
that returns the model object. 

Now, `house` is exported

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mod <- house()
```


# select_sims

There is a series of dplyr-like functions that allow you to work on the 
simulation output object (`mrgsims`) while keeping it a simulation output 
object.  Starting in version `0.10.1`, we have a `select_sims` function which 
allows you to select certain columns in the simulation object

```{r}
out <- mrgsim(house(), ev(amt = 100))

out 

out <- select_sims(out, RESP, CP)

out
```

Notice that `ID` and `time` are retained.  The motivation here is to allow you
to request many columns and then pare back so that, for example, plotting is 
more convenient

```{r}
plot(out)
```

Other functions include

```{r}
mutate_sims(out, name = "kyle")
```

```{r}
filter_sims(out, time > 2)
```

Notice in all of these operations, the `mrgsims` object is returned.  If you 
want to `mutate` or `select` and get a `tibble` back, then just call

```{r}
mutate(out, name = "Kyle")
```

# Plot from character vector of column names


The plot method has so far required you to enter a formula to select columns to
plot
```{r}
out <- mrgsim(house(), ev(amt = 100))

plot(out, CP~time)
```


This works well is many circumstances.  The new feature here is that you can
list the columns to plot as a character vector.  Let's mrgsolve determine what
column to put on the x-axis

```{r}
plot(out, "CP RESP GUT")
```

The motivation came from simulations that I was doing where there were a lot 
of columns in the output and I had many different panel plots I wanted to make. 
It was helpful to select the columns in a character vector rather than typing 
out the formula

```{r}
mod <- modlib("pbpk")

out <- mrgsim(mod, ev(amt = 100))
```

```{r}
set1 <- "Aad Abo Abr Ahe"
set2 <- "Ave Are Ask Asp Ali Aki"

plot(out, set1)

plot(out, set2)
```

As you expect with mrgsolve, there is no need to specify a real R vector for 
listing the column names.  We'll split a string on space or comma.  For this 
feature, we'll also split on newline (helpful when the names are very long or 
you just want some structure to the layout

```{r}
set3 <- '
  Aad Abo Abr Ahe
  Ave Are Ask Asp Ali Aki
'

plot(out, set3)
```


# outvars

Query the model object for the names of variables that you could ask for in a 
simulation

```{r}
outvars(house())
```

Some names are compartments, some are captured.


# Improvements to event objects

To make an event object
```{r}
ev(amt = 100)
```

We can reference names in the object during construction

```{r}
ev(amt = 100, rate = amt/2)
```


I can also access columns in the event object
```{r}
x <- ev(amt = 100, rate = amt/3)
x$rate
```

And we have been able to mutate these objects for a while now

```{r}
x <- ev(amt = 100) 

mutate(x, rate = amt / 5)
```


Check out the `tinf` argument to say how long you want an infusion to last

```{r}
ev(amt = 100, tinf = 3)
```



# New error message

You might see this

```{r}
dose <- ev(amt = 100)

try(mrgsim(dose, mod))
```

Which just means you passed things in in the wrong order. 


# Steady state infusion

mrgsolve can now run a zero-order infusion to steady state.  Set `amt` to 0, 
`rate` to something positive and `ss` to 1.  We change `recsort` just to show 
that things start at steady state.

```{r}
ssinf <- ev(amt = 0, rate = 5, ss = 1)

mrgsim(house(), event = ssinf, recsort=3) %>% plot
```

You can also set `rate` to -1 if you are modeling the rate.  But it can't be 
set to `-2`. 

# Access model information

For a while, you could access model parameters with `$` operator

```{r}
mod <- house()

mod$CL
```

Now you can access initial compartment values

```{r}
mod$RESP
```


And other goodies

```{r}
mod$end
```

# Access compartment numbers

Sometimes when writing a model, we would like to know the number of a 
compartment when we only know the name.  There is a plugin to make that doable
now


```{c,eval=FALSE}
$CMT CENTRAL

$PLUGIN N_CMT

$MAIN

if(CMT==N_CENTRAL) {
  // ......
}
```
