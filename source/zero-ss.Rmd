title: "Zero-order steady state infusion"

```{r,include=FALSE}
options(mrgsolve.soloc = "build")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = '.', warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

# Introduction

Starting with version 0.10.0 (released October, 2019), mrgsolve can implement 
dosing records calling for a zero-order infusion at steady state.  To do this, 
set `rate` to a non-zero value, `amt` to zero, and `ss` to 1.


# Example

For a 10 mg/hr infusion at steady state

```{r}
library(mrgsolve)
library(dplyr)

mod <- house(end = 72, delta = 0.1) %>% update(outvars = "CP")

mod <- param(mod, CL = 2)

dose <- ev(amt = 0, rate = 100, ss = 1, cmt = 2)
```

The dosing event looks like

```{r}
dose
```


With `CL` set to 2, we expect the system to start out at 50
```{r}
mrgsim(mod,dose,recsort = 3) %>% plot()
```

# Notes

- It is an error to include addl
- You can model the rate
  - Set `rate` to -1 in the input data
  - Set `R_CMT` in `[main]`
- It is an error to try to model the duration
  - Set `rate` to -2 in the input data
  - Set `D_CMT` in `[main]`
