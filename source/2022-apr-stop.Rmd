Sometimes you have a simulation that is running longer than it needs to run 
or longer than you want it to run. Some examples include

- you create a large input data set and send it off for simulation, but you 
  discovered an error in the code while the simulation was running
- maybe the simulation is running longer than you thought it would and you want 
  to kill it to take a closer look
- you have run the system until some critical event happened (the patient was 
  cured!) and you really don't need to simulate that last 5 year of treatment
- you want to let a simulation run for 3 minutes maximum; if it is not done by 
  then, just give up and move on

This blog post is about stopping those runs and most of the time, this requires
writing a bit of code into the model. 

# User interrupt

When mrgsolve is simulating a data set, it stops every so often to check for the
user interrupt signal (Control-C or Esc). So if you have some regrets after
starting a simulation, hit Control-C or Esc a bunch of times and that will 
eventually stop the simulation. 

mrgsolve has to stop to check for user interrupt; we don't want to stop to 
frequently so as to hurt performance, but we don't want to stop too 
infrequently either - that would make you have to wait too long to stop the 
simulation. By default, mrgsolve counts the records that is processes and 
stops every`256` records to look for the interrupt. This default value can be
checked or modified as the `interrupt` argument to `mrgsim()` and friends.
If you have both observations and records in your data set, this check interval
will roughly correspond to every `256` output records. I say `roughly` because 
mrgsolve also counts some records that aren't in your data set but still 
get implemented (like turning off an infusion). You might want it to look more
frequently if you have a model that is very difficult to solve or if you have 
long spans of time between records. You might want to check less often if 
the model is very easy to solve. You can set `interrupt` to a negative number 
to have is avoid checking at all. Most of the time, it is not necessary to 
change the check interval.

# Stopping a model early 

mrgsolve has some `C++` functions that you can write into your model that will 
stop the simulation once some condition is met. The functions are

- `self.stop()`
- `self.stop_id()`
- `self.stop_id_cf()`

We'll walk through each of them. 

To stop the simulation and throw an error, use 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
self.stop();
```

This can be called in `$MAIN` or `$TABLE` and it will just stop the simulation
with an error message. You can catch this condition by wrapping the simulation 
call in `try()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
output <- try(mrsim(model, data))
```

and then check to see if the simulation failed

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if(inherits(output, "try-error")) {
  # bail out  
} else {
  # keep going  
}
```

If you want to just stop simulating the _current individual_, you can use 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
self.stop_id();
```

or 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
self.stop_id_cf();
```

Both of these will stop _simulating_ the current subject and then move on to the 
next subject. The difference in behavior comes from what gets filled in for 
the remaining records for that subject. 

- `self.stop_id()` fills in the remaining rows with `NA_real_` so that an easy 
  way to find the stopping point is to select records where `ID` is not `NA`
- `self.stop_id_cf()` fills in the remaining rows with the last simulated value; 
  this approach might be useful in more limited circumstances, but available if
  needed
  

# Setting a maximum run time

It is possible to limit the simulation time for an individual or for the entire
problem. This isn't handled automatically by mrgsolve, but we'll show you how 
to write a small bit of code to do this in a very flexible way.

Recall that the `$PREAMBLE` block gets called _once_ at the start of the problem. 

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$GLOBAL
#include <time.h>

$PREAMBLE
time_t tstart = time(0);
```


In `$PREAMBLE`, I got the current time with `time(0)` and saved it to `tstart` 
The units for `start` are `seconds`. Also note that we had to `#include` the 
header file (`<time.h>`) to get that function. 

Now, we'll write some code to check the elapsed time in `$TABLE` and set a 
maximum run duration in `$PARAM`

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$PARAM MAXTIME = 180

$TABLE
if( (tstart - time(0) ) > MAXTIME) {
  self.stop_id();
}
```

So once the run time exceeds `MAXTIME` (180 seconds), we will stop the run 
graciously using `self.stop_id()`. You could make a case for using `self.stop()`
here too, but you get the picture: you can determine (1) when to check the 
duration (2) what is the maximum duration (3) what to do when the maximum 
duration is exceeded, etc. The behavior is really up to you with a little bit
of coding. 

I like this pattern and have plans to write a `[ plugin ]` that will make 
coding this a little easier. Stay tuned.
