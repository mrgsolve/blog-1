title: "Time after dose (TAD)"

# TAD calculated as runtime argument

For a while, you've been able to get time after dose in your simulated 
output

```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(mrgsolve)
library(tidyverse)

mod <- modlib("pk1", req = "")

mod %>% 
  ev(amt = 100, ii = 4, addl = 3, time = 2) %>%
  mrgsim(tad = TRUE, add = c(3.888,5.91)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(n = 10)
  
```

This is convenient because you can choose the output at run time, 
we give you the negative numbers prior to the first dose etc.  This 
sort of calculation is possible because we let mrgsolve know 
ahead of time that we want this calculation done and mrgsolve
makes an extra pass through the records to find when is the 
first dose for each individual.

# TAD calculated in the model
Sometimes you would like to work with time after dose in
your model.  This isn't super-complicated to do but does 
require some programming and setup and all of that. As of 
mrgsolve 0.9.1, there is a special function to do these 
calculations for you.


```{r,message=FALSE}
mod <- mread("time_after_dose.txt",req = "")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- readLines("time_after_dose.txt",warn=FALSE) %>% modelparse()
```
Looking at the `[MAIN]` block:
```{c,eval=FALSE, code = x$MAIN}

```


When you call `self.tad()` you will get the time after dose.  It's
important that this gets called on every record ... specifically every dosing record.  It will not work properly if it is not called every 
record and there is no check at this time to make sure you follow 
that rule.  So please follow the rule.

To see an example:

```{c, eval=FALSE, code = mod@code}
```


```{r}
mod %>% 
  ev(amt = 100, ii = 4, addl = 3, time = 2) %>%
  mrgsim(tad = TRUE, add = c(3.888,5.91)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  head(n = 10)
```


You will notice two differences between `tad` (output requested at 
run time) and `tadose` (values calculated in the model itself) in the 
output listing above:  

1. `tadose` is -1 before the first dose
1. specifically, `tadose` is -1 at the 2 hour observation record
   that occurs that the same time as the dose, but happens before 
   the dose in record order

The main point if this is that you can easily obtain time after 
dose in the problem (model) itself to use as you program the model
and also output the number into the simulated output.
