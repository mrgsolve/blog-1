There are a bunch of new features out now in the mrgsolve 1.0.0 release. Most 
of these are related to model syntax (what / how you write your model in the 
`.mod` or `.cpp` file) rather than model functionality. 

# Use THETA(n) to refer to THETAn

All models will be able to use `THETA(n)` to refer to `THETAn`. For example:


```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ nmxml ] 
run = 100
root = "cppfile"

[ main ] 
double CL = THETA(1) * pow(WT/70, 0.75);
```

You'll notice that we referred to a nonmem run with `[ nmxml ]` so this syntax
is meant be one small step toward making it easier to translate your model 
from the nonmem control stream to mrgsolve format. This is pretty simple, but 
will mean less time removing parentheses when copying over model code. 

# New plugin called `autodec`

Plugins are extra functionality that you can invoke when coding your model. 
For example, plugins exist for calculating time after dose, adding Rcpp 
functionality to your model etc and [more](https://mrgsolve.org/user_guide/model-specification.html#block-plugin).

One new plugin is called `autodec`. This plugin will automatically declare 
C++ variables for you. For example, I can code the snipped from the previous
block using `autodec` plugin and mrgsolve will discover that `CL` needs to be
declared:

```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ plugin ] autodec

[ nmxml ] 
run = 100
root = "cppfile"

[ main ] 
CL = THETA(1) * pow(WT/70, 0.75);
```

The motivation behind this feature is to make it easier to code models with 
lots of variables when all your variables are simple double precision floating 
point numbers.

# New plugin called `nm-vars`

This plugin provided a nonmem-like syntax for _certain model elements_, 
including 

- `Fn`, `Dn`, `Rn`, and `ALAGn`
- `A(n)`, `A_0(n)` and `DADT(n)`
- `T` (used for `SOLVERTIME` in `$ODE`)

So your mrgsolve model translated from nonmem might look like this

```{r, results = "hide"}
see(modlib("nm-like"))
```

```{c, eval=FALSE, code = modlib("nm-like", compile = FALSE)@code}

```

where I updated the internal model `1005` to reflect use of both `autodec` and 
`nm-vars` plugins. 

Notice that __not all nonmem syntax is supported__; just select data structures
that use `A` and `DADT` to refer to compartments and differential equations.
Also notice that we still require `;` at the end of each line and we still 
need to use `pow(base, exponent)` to calculate exponent of some number. 

# Compartment

The `$CMT` block has two new options: `@number` and `@prefix` that let you 
quickly specify a numbered series of compartments in the model similar to 
nonmem. The default `@prefix` is `A` so that this code

```{c, eval = FALSE}
$CMT @number 3
```

will put compartments `A1`, `A2`, `A3` into your model. 

# New model in `modlib`: `nm-like`

You can see a model coded with these new syntax features in the internal model
library; the model is called `nm-like`

```{r, message = FALSE}
mod <- modlib("nm-like")
see(mod)
```

Here, I've coded the `THETA`s in a parameter block; these would ordinarily 
come into the model via `$NMXML` or `$NMEXT`, which automatically import these
parameters and estimates. But note that we can still refer to `THETA(1)` and 
others ... this resolves to `THETA1` regardless.


# Audit 

When mrgsolve loads your model, it checks the `$ODE` block to make sure you have
differential equations for every compartment in your model. A long time ago, 
I started calling this check `audit` and it was something that was on by default
but could be turned off via the call to `mread()`. 

Starting with version 1.0.0, `audit` can be controlled at the `$ODE` block 
level like this

```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ ode ] @audit

dxdt_A1 = ...
dxdt_A2 = ...
```

to explicitly tell mrgsolve to audit the equations or

```{c, eval = FALSE}
[ ode ] @!audit

dxdt_A1 = ...
dxdt_A2 = ...
```

to disable the audit. The audit is on by default and should only be turned off
when you have written some special construct in `[ ode ]` to code the 
differential equations (e.g. odes are written programmatically). 


# New time spacer for event sequences

The new feature is an `ii` spacer for sequences of event objects. 

Using [event objects](https://mrgsolve.org/user_guide/event-chapter.html), 
we can create complicated dosing regimens from simpler ones. For example, we
might have a week of 50 mg dosing followed by a week of 100 mg dosing and then 
up to 200 mg dosing. We can accomplish that with an event sequence

First create the individual pieces

```{r}
a <- ev(amt = 50,  ii = 24, addl = 6)
b <- ev(amt = 100, ii = 24, addl = 6)
c <- ev(amt = 200, ii = 24, addl = 6)
```

Then put them in a sequence

```{r}
data <- ev_seq(a, b, c)
data
```

When they are sequenced, you'll see that the second piece (`b`) starts one
dosing interval after the last dose in the first piece (`a`). 

We can put a 24 hour spacer between `a` and `b`

```{r}
seq(a, wait = 24, b)
```

Here, the last dose in `a` is given, we wait one dosing interval (24 hours) then 
wait another 24 hours (via `wait`) and then start `b`. 

Rather than using `wait`, we can use `ii` to specify the amount of time 
from the last dose in `a` to the first dose in `b`. So if we want to wait 3 days
between the last dose in `a` and the first dose in `b`

```{r}
ev_seq(a, ii = 3*24, b)
```

Notice that this same behavior can be achieved with `wait` but using `ii` 
might be easier to interpret in some cases. 

#  Collapse matrices

Sometimes in your model, you have multiple OMEGA or SIGMA blocks like this

```{r}
code <- '
$OMEGA  @name first
1 2 3

$OMEGA @name second
4
'
mod <- mcode("collapse", code, compile = FALSE)

omat(mod)
```


If I want to update these values but I only have a 4x4 matrix

```{r, include = FALSE}
mat <- as.matrix(omat(mod))  / 10

```

```{r}
mat
```

I can't do it; mrgsolve wants a 3x3 matrix for the first slot and 1x1 matrix
for the second. 

A new function will collapse the model matrix into larger matrices

```{r}
mod <- collapse_omega(mod)
omat(mod)
```

```{r}
mod <- update(mod, omat = mat)
omat(mod)
```

You can't split matrices up into smaller chunks, but if there are more than 
two blocks, you can select which blocks to join

```{r}
code <- '
$OMEGA  @name first
1 2 3

$OMEGA @name second
4

$OMEGA @name third
5 6 7 8
'
mod <- mcode("collapse2", code, compile = FALSE)

omat(mod)

mod <- collapse_omega(mod, range = c(2, NA), name = "remainder")
omat(mod)
```


# Deprecated simeta(n) and simeps(n)

We recently rolled out a feature where the user could call `simeta()` and 
pass an integer that would indicate a single `ETA()` to update, leaving the 
others alone. This proved to be more than a little dangerous when `$OMEGA`
had off-diagonal elements. We will be deprecating this feature starting 
with version 1.0.0.  When you load a model that contains `simeta(n)` or 
`simeps(n)`, there will be a warning about the syntax. The warning 
includes some code you can write to silence the warning, but this will be 
temporary. In a future release, we will always warn when this syntax us used
and eventually generate an error. It is recommended to always use `simeta()`
or `simeps()` when re-simulating random effects.
