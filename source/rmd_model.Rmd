title: "Rmarkdown model specification"

# Introduction

I was an Emacs user for a long time and thought I'd never give it up.  But 
like a lot of other people, Rstudio grew on me and I use it for all my R, C++
and Rcpp work.  It just works well.  

# The problem
When I write mrgsolve models, I typically save the code to a file with `.cpp`
extension (e.g. `pkmodel.cpp`) so that I get nice syntax highlighting that 
Rstudio provides.  One thing that bugs me about this setup is that Rstudio 
naturally thinks **all** the code in `pkmodel.cpp` is C++ code.  But for mrgsolve
models, only part of the code is C++.  Other parts are R or just other syntax
that we made up.  This means the auto-formatting that Rstudio does doesn't 
always work that great.  

# Some solutions
There are a couple of ways to make this less-irritating.  First, you can 
use brackets for code blocks like this 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
[ PARAM] CL = 1, V = 20
```

rather than this

```{r,eval=FALSE}
$PARAM CL = 1, V = 20
```

I think this helps a bit.  You could also save your model to `pkmodel.txt`
rather than `pkmodel.cpp`.  You will lose all of the C++ conveniences but 
Rstudio won't try to auto-format your code.  This might not be a great solution
either. 

# Rmarkdown model specification

Another way to deal with this is to write your model in Rmarkdown format.  This 
is new in version `0.9.1` and will probably need some tweaking.  But I'm generally
happy with the way it's working so far.  

The models run the same regardless of how you code them.  But in the Rmarkdown
input format, writing the code might be a little more natural. Also, consistent
the the Rmarkdown / literate programming philosophy, you can document your 
model right as you code the model, but with structured markdown input.

For example you can now load this model

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(mrgsolve)
options(mrgsolve.soloc = "build")

mod <- mread_cache("popex.Rmd", modlib())
```

This is just a pop-PK model.  You can take a closer look at the code 
[here](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/mrgsolve/blob/master/inst/models/popex.Rmd). 
```{r}
mod %>% ev(amt = 100) %>% mrgsim(nid = 30, end = 72) %>% plot()
```

But it's written in Rmd format

```{r,comment= '.'}
cat(mod@code, sep = "\n")
```

At the top of the document, there is regular yaml front matter, with a title
(and optionally date, author etc).  I have also included `output` which is 
set to `mrgsolve:::document`.  The `:::` indicates that `document` is not 
exported from the mrgsolve namespace.  But using this output lets you knit
this document in Rstudio (with the knit button) and you will get some 
html output. This just renders the code into a nice format (with all the comments
and section headers you include in regular old Rmarkdown format). The 
`mrgsolve:::document` output type defines all sorts of engines like `param`
and `cmt` and `main` and `ode` etc.  These are block names like you would write
in the original input specification (`$PARAM` and `$CMT` etc).  So only code
in backticks with an engine will be handled as proper model code, the rest
is discarded. There are absolutely no differences in how the code itself is 
handled with either the Rmd input format or the traditional input format. The 
only difference is the code used to mark the end of one block and the 
start of another block. 

If you want to write (and evaluate) some R code, use the `R` engine.

The only way to properly process a file written like this is if it has the 
extension `.Rmd` or `.rmd`.  So only use those extensions if you have 
written your model with the Rmarkdown block delimiters.
